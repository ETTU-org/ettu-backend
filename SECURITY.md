# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ETTU team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@ettu.dev`
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in the repository
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP key available upon request

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 3 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will send updates every 5 business days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not take legal action against you if you follow this policy

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with httpOnly cookies
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding to prevent XSS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policies

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers implementation
- **Database Isolation**: Separate database credentials and network isolation
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events

### Code Security

- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code analysis for security issues
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak information
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety guarantees

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
2. **Testing**: Write security tests for all authentication and authorization code
3. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date and audit regularly
4. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets to version control
5. **Logging**: Log security events but never log sensitive information

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep your client applications updated
4. **Secure Networks**: Use HTTPS and avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations
5. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious activity immediately

### For Administrators

1. **Server Security**: Keep server software updated and properly configured
2. **Database Security**: Use strong database credentials and network isolation
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity and security events
4. **Backups**: Maintain secure, regular backups of all data
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents

## Vulnerability Management

### Assessment Process

1. **Triage**: Classify severity and impact of the vulnerability
2. **Verification**: Reproduce the issue and confirm its validity
3. **Impact Analysis**: Assess potential damage and affected systems
4. **Fix Development**: Develop and test a fix for the vulnerability
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the fix to production systems
6. **Verification**: Confirm the fix resolves the issue
7. **Disclosure**: Coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Complete system compromise, data breach, or remote code execution
- **High**: Significant data exposure, privilege escalation, or authentication bypass
- **Medium**: Limited data exposure, denial of service, or information disclosure
- **Low**: Minor information disclosure or issues with limited impact

### Response Actions

- **Critical/High**: Immediate response, emergency patches, system isolation if needed
- **Medium**: Response within 3 days, patches in next planned release
- **Low**: Response within 7 days, patches in upcoming releases

## Compliance

### Standards

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against the most common web application vulnerabilities
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system compliance
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability compliance

### Auditing

- **Internal Audits**: Regular security audits by our team
- **External Audits**: Annual third-party security assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing by security professionals
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of all systems
